    "description": "Project Introduction:\n\"Herstory\" is a 3D escape room game that integrates VR technology and local cooperative gameplay for two players. It discusses feminism and promotes traditional Chinese culture while challenging and redefining conventional historical narratives by recounting and commemorating historically marginalized female heroes. Traditional historical narratives often revolve around men, with countless extraordinary and great women fading into oblivion, often only appearing as appendages to men. These women, who broke through numerous feudal restrictions against them, are neither celebrated, their achievements are often credited to others, or even stigmatized... In many cultures, it is said that death is not the end; being forgotten is. Players are chosen to witness and bear the responsibility of passing down and celebrating their history and are guided to reflect on deeper feminist issues. \"Herstory\" aims to explore and present the stories that truly belong to these women, or \"Her story,\" through the medium of a game. In the game, players will have the opportunity to learn about N\u00fcshu, a mysterious and unique script used by women, discover ancient Chinese female figures rarely recorded in history, and express their respect and commemoration through the traditional ritual of offering incense to these women.\n\nBackground Story:\nIn many cultures, there exists a belief that death is not the final end; being forgotten is the true oblivion. Traditional historical narratives often revolve around men, relegating women to mere footnotes as attachments to men, leading to countless distinguished and great women fading from collective memory as history flows on. One day in 2024, a historian inadvertently steps into a decrepit temple, unknowingly crossing the edge of time. A mysterious spirit, wielding her profound knowledge of astrology, gathers the waning powers of other female spirits from various dynasties, who are gradually dissipating, summoning the historian into a special realm. This temple is a sanctuary preserved by their collective strength, untouched by the ravages of time. However, as these spirits become increasingly forgotten by the world, their power wanes, and this special realm faces the fate of fading away along with the spirits. To rescue these spirits and restore the temple to its former glory, the player is bestowed with an extraordinary mission: to traverse through time and space, deciphering the N\u00fcshu, the women's script, to unveil the hidden truths of history. By conducting the ritual of offering incense to venerate these spirits, the stories of these female historical heroines can be sung once more, regaining their glory and ensuring their legacy endures.",

The barrelman takes caution and scopes out a sea monster ahead, advising the helmsman to steer clear. The helmsman ignores his request and sails straight into danger, ready to be awarded the bounty money after slaying the beast. Meanwhile, the bilgerat is busy staring out at sea hoping to see a beautiful mermaid. Blackwater Buccaneers doesn't just make you play as a pirate. It turns you INTO one.",

    "description": "Penglai is a concept in Chinese mythology that shares common elements with different folklores in China and Japan. At the heart of this myth is the divine tree with its fruits as a symbol of the desire for immortality and growth. Eternity, growth and connection are concepts echoed across global cultures, such as Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life, and the Egyptian Acacia. These similarities suggest a common perspective across diverse cultures.  This work explores the possibility of a magical interconnection between our aboriginal cultures and asks a compelling question: Are the divine trees described in various cultures distinct beings, or do they originate from a single, ancient source? Incorporating a silver snake, a creature stepping in transformative symbolism, along with the combination of clay and lotus as a hint of the origin, riverstones as the land, and a disco ball representing the sun, casting fragmented yet harmonious light, the work creates a space where past and present, global and local, and the celestial and terrestrial converge. This convergence compels us to consider that maybe the commons between us are more than we think.",

This exhibition utilizes interactive screens and videos to educate audiences on the interconnectedness between diverse species and showcasing how this intricate web of interactions could manifest on another habitable world. It allows viewers to marvel at the mutualistic bonds between organisms, emphasizing their collective ability not only to flourish on Earth but also potentially in the vast expanses of outer space.\n\nUltimately, \"Illuminating Harmony\" invites viewers to wonder how we might draw lessons from these harmonious relationships among species and utilize them as tools for sustaining life\u2014both on our home planet and beyond.",

In a world yearning for profound connections and inspiring experiences, redefining how we engage with knowledge and creativity is not just a question but a necessity.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the natural wonders of our planet and guided by the principles of Earth's ecosystems, \u201cAetheria: Celestial Unveiling\u201d paints a vivid portrait of extraterrestrial life. Through a fusion of physical installation and digital technology, the piece aims to blur the boundaries between the familiar and the unknown, offering audiences a glimpse into the biodiversity that may exist beyond our solar system.\n\nThe installation invites active engagement, prompting participants to become co-creators of the experience. By taking participants through a journey of sights, sounds, and sensations of an alien ecosystem, it challenges them to reconsider their relationship with the natural world and contemplate the interconnectedness of all living things. In doing so, Aetheria offers a glimpse into a future where art, science, and technology converge to deepen our understanding of the universe and our place within it.",

    "description": "Monster is a film about personal struggles with mental blocks, the fear of failure, and being diagnosed with BPD. This film contains some horror elements, but is not intended to be scary. Instead, the hope is to use certain horror tropes to examine the feelings of our main character as she traverses an unwelcome environment. Animation, characters, story, and voice acting is by me. Joe Shoen created the audio experience.",

    "description": "Who are you? Who are we? What can we create when our minds come together? How can we blend together? This sonic experience aims to focus on a unique moment when two human minds come together to create a multisensory experience, which can only be created in this exact moment in life, showing us the importance of fleeting moments and our minds reaction to stimuli. An experience that is purely driven by two people\u2019s minds and the synchrony between one another.  \n\nSana\u2019s journey in creating Waves of Us was inspired by two moving experiences in her life: a sound bath in Bali, Indonesia and a sound sculptured theater in San Francisco, California that is experienced in pitch darkness. Both experiences had common characteristics in that they are based on impact to an individual by sound and vibrations. This paired with Sana\u2019s user experience background and constant desire to understand humans on a psychological level, pushed her to see what else she could explore when it came to human beings, which is where Biofeedback comes in. Biofeedback is the study of humans based on body functions in order to create the best personalized experience.\n\nIn order to utilize the right Biofeedback tool for the installation, Sana tested multiple biofeedback tools including a machine learning voice model she developed to pick up emotion via speech tone, a face API for emotion detection, pulse oximeter and EEG headset to understand what tools best picked up on human emotion. After extensive testing she landed on using the EEG headset by Muse as the best and accurate tool to use for this installation due to its ability to capture brainwaves. \n\nThe biofeedback space is still a new and emerging industry that has not been fully tapped into when creating digital and physical experiences. Sana would like to continue to contribute to this subject area by using meaningful data she is capturing in impactful and impressionable ways for users.",

For my senior project, my goal is to create the interface for a (21+) drinking game app that is primarily used in groups of people to break the ice and allow people to laugh, drink, and learn more about each other. The app would only require one person to have it downloaded, so it will not be an entirely individualistic digital/online experience, rather everyone will interact in person, guided by the content on one phone. The app is timeless and has a multitude of games ranging from card games, word play, roulette and more. Its built so groups of people don't have to face dreadful small talk, and can enjoy each-others company together without forcing conversations.",

I go through various blueprints and 3D models for a web-based virtual office with the goal of encouraging casual social encounters.\n\nThe final outcome of my thesis is an interactive virtual office space, hosted by a WebXR tool that provides real-time communication between users. By purposefully designing the spatial layout and placing interactive elements within the space, my work aims to foster informal \u201cwatercooler\u201d moments often missed in remote settings. This research-driven process delves into an important question at the intersection of remote work and immersive technology: With the vast design possibilities enabled by WebXR, how might we strategically architect virtual office spaces for social connectivity?",

I was diagnosed with BPD my sophomore year of college and started therapy for the first time in my life. Recognizing the privilege of receiving treatment, my goal is to reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness and increase the accessibility of therapy resources through this project.  While DBT is traditionally taught through the DBT Skills Training Manual by Marsha M. Linehan, I aimed to reimagine its presentation. Through color, typography and composition, my zine transforms the dense material into a visually pleasing and digestible format. Through visual storytelling, I hope to advocate for increased support and resources for those in need.",

However, using them can be stressful for some people who may experience sensory sensitivities. Individuals may get uncomfortable or experience resistance by loud noises or smells that may come from the printer. This problem isn't talked about enough, even though it affects a lot of areas like schools, hospitals, and tech companies. My research deals with finding ways to make one's sensory experience with a 3D printer feel at ease and comfortable.",

In the last few decades with the industrial and information ages, the changes have been even more radical, and as we go about our busy everyday lives it becomes difficult to truly grasp the scale and pace at which human society and behaviour are changing. \nIt makes one wish for a witness, a recording device, a diary perhaps, that has been present through all the different times that have passed and continue to pass. This artefact would record, through its form, its content, and the socioeconomic contexts it was produced in how things have changed over time.\nAnd that\u2019s how the grocery list came to mind. An ordinary, commonplace, and inconspicuous artefact that has been in use ever since humans learned to write. The aim of this project is to collect and observe grocery lists found in history but also in the present and the possible future. What does the way we make grocery lists say about us and what do our lists have the ability to reveal? Through this installation you will be surprised to find out how much our ever present grocery lists can know, see and tell about us.",

It uses metaphors, colors, and sounds to evoke a journey of self-discovery and reconciliation. This project focuses on visualizing emotional processes and the transformation from internal conflict to peace, positioning itself within the context of contemporary art and psychological study. It aims to connect deeply with the viewer, encouraging a reflective journey towards personal serenity.",

    "description": "I chose to create a horror game for my senior project. This game tends to provide players with strong sensory stimulation. Although there are a lot of amazing games out there for educational purposes, I like to make games that are only for entertainment. I\u2019m not the type of person who is trying to teach people a lesson or talk about controversial ideas in my games. All I want is for people to enjoy the process of playing. Because I think people should have time that they do not need to think about the actual social issues that are happening in the real world. People deserve a break. Therefore, being able to relax and like the game experience after playing the game are the goals that I\u2019m trying to achieve.\nI like to play games and I also like to watch people walking through the storylines of games. There are many times that I can feel empathy and touch for in-game characters after knowing the entire storylines. Lots of the 2D and 3D dark adventure games such as Sally Face, Black Mirror Series, Resident Evil, etc. were my inspiration for this project. \nThe Forgotten Village is a dark adventure game that follows Conner(the main character) to discover his past and reveal an unspeakable story. In the end, Connor is going to to defeat the greatest fear that is inside of his own heart.",

This project stands out by emphasizing physical engagement, diverging from the traditional farming games that rely solely on screen-based interactions through clicks and presses. Players interact with tangible objects on the controller, with each action designed to mimic real-world farming activities (e.g., sowing involves placing seeds into a soil compartment, and fruits emerge during the harvesting process). This experimental approach to physical interaction, drawing from real-life farming practices, aims to explore ways to enhance the game's sense of reward and engagement.",

    "description": "InclusiveRealms is a Virtual Reality (VR) experience that aims to tackle the problems of Physical Accessibility in a virtual environment. It all started out when my mother was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and due to this she was unable to pick up or hold anything, much less put on a VR headset without feeling an immense amount of pain; just like this there are many other physical disabilities that hinder users from experiencing the full potential of VR. Physical, and digital accessibility are still some of the major barriers to the widespread adoption and enjoyment of VR experiences. Despite VR\u2019s ability to help people, VR interactions are plagued with complex controllers, intricate button configurations, and physically demanding actions. Individuals with disabilities, limited mobility, or cognitive impairments may find it hard to navigate current interfaces. As a result of this, many potential users are excluded from fully accessing and benefiting from VR technology. In order to create a more inclusive and enjoyable virtual reality experience, the objective is to integrate the natural dexterity and user familiarity of hand movements in an experience to provide a more seamless experience. The project aims to tackle the challenges to accessibility in a VR environment by developing intuitive hand-based gestures as an alternative to traditional interaction methods. This project explores intuitive hand-based gestures for virtual reality interactions in order to achieve this goal. There are two parts to this project. The first part is an accessibility guideline for virtual reality, which will be available on a website to read the clear details and help users keep in consideration these aspects when designing and developing for VR and in the headset itself as a debug tool for creators when they are play-testing their environment. The second part is an experience that will aim to educate users on newly designed, intuitive hand gestures to help them communicate and experience VR in a better way.",

This platform enables users to upload spatial coordinates to serve as a canvas, allowing friends and collaborators to engage in AR art creation from various locations and times. This not only opens up new avenues for artistic expression but also fosters a unique social experience. Moreover, companies and institutions can leverage this technology to share spaces like building facades or public walls as AR canvases, inviting public creation and display. This tool is poised to blend creativity, community, and technology, transforming public and private spaces into interactive art experiences.\n\nIn response to the isolation brought by global challenges, InterARt reimagines connection and creativity. Users begin by scanning a space\u2014a potential canvas\u2014then share it with the world. Across the globe, individuals add their artistic touch, drawing directly on this communal canvas. The magic unfolds when these artworks are viewed on-site through AR, bringing a digital masterpiece into the physical realm.\n\nThis platform bridges distances, offering a communal space for creativity that defies physical barriers. It's more than just an art tool; it's a means to connect, heal, and celebrate our shared humanity in times of isolation. Through this blend of technology and art, we invite a global audience to participate in a collective, creative journey, transforming solitary spaces into shared artistic experiences.",

As international students from across the world, we have embraced the culture, norms, and lifestyle in New York. Through the process, many of us have either started to think of the city as our home or are yet to come to terms with the changing lifestyle. Home often means more than just the four walls in a world where people are constantly moving from place to place locally or globally in search of better opportunities or situational circumstances. While, trying to understand my idea of what home means to me, looking through the photos on my phone I realized how each place that I lived, contributed to the larger concept of home for me, where it was not just a single place but a culmination of these multiple memories, longing, nostalgia and incidents that contributed to my understanding of home. As I searched for a community and belonging, where and how I thought of home to be, became a significant question.  This project is an exploration of the idea and concept of a home through the approach of documenting it through the medium of VR, portraying the idea through the views of certain individuals and their experiences.",

However, there is a hyperfixation on the origin of the materials, leading to a failure to couple durable recycled materials with well researched design and craftsmanship. The Peppered Paul has set out to fill that gap in the market by creating a dog bed that you will never have to throw away, keeping even once recycled materials from adding to the incredible 14.57 minion tons of pet waste thrown out each year. This project began as a search for a \u201cchew proof\u201d sustainable dog bed for family, clients and friends who\u2019s dogs regularly go through over fifteen beds per year and often struggle with blockages from the ingested materials. From working in the pet industry and knowing the scale of waste produced both by low quality products and production, I saw a space for innovation that could not only make a difference in the industry, but also improve the lives of individual pets and pet parent\u2019s.",

By utilizing their data, I create abstract interpretations of celestial bodies, shedding light on the limitations of data-driven representations. Drawing on Foucault's discourse on knowledge and power, this project aims to critique how subjective portrayals of the universe shape our perception of reality, inviting viewers to reconsider the role of artistic interpretation in understanding the cosmos.",

As well as representing this uncanny transformation, the project encourages the audience to question our interactions with and increased social dependance on AI tools, specifically their effects on our perceptions of the past. What would your childhood bedroom look like if it wasn't \"real\"? How do you know it ever was \"real\"? What about your grandmother's face? What is identity in a world where digital manipulation and fabrication has surpassed the realm of truth?",

    "description": "In order to understand color, we must unweave the rainbow. This project began with a deep dive into the what, why, and how of color theory, but the most consistent answer to any question is that color deceives continually. Young artists are taught to draw what they truly see, not what they think they see. That tree is not a tree, it is a collection of abstract blobs of color, light, and lines butting up against each other. Painters squint, look at things through mirrors, all for a \u201cfresh pair of eyes\u201d. Deconstruction, abstraction, and objectivity are essential to capturing true color. My process is centered on this method of decontextualization as a means to get to the purity of an idea, to then synthesize it into something new. \n\nImages from art history and the natural world are plotted in a 3D CIE Lab Color Space, where each pixel value is shown in an organic cloud of data. From there, 3D sculpts of these new forms were made in virtual reality, a translation of the original work into a study of pure color in the digital world. The data maps color in isolation, but still holds a spirit of the original image through it\u2019s weight, movement, and physicality. The viewer is encouraged to sit with these forms and study how color moves\u2014because it is the in between, the interaction of color that holds the most expressive power.",

The rapid development left the poorer population behind while the rest were conditioned to believe they deserved the best. The standards fell and people grew bitter. Resources were exhausted and eventually, the final resource; the human race; fell to the growth of the US oligarchy, and was ultimately exhausted. The final members of the human race sought to restructure the war-time tech into the humane solutions everyone desired, and so we arrive at Earth-125 (2250 AD). Though the solutions failed to save humans from extinction, our technology carried on to integrate into the current ecosystem, creating a symbiosis with the general population. My project hopes to show the direction of our development and the consequence of allowing business to continue \"as usual\". The current world calls for much more attention to which organizations we align with and what causes we directly or indirectly align with.",

The most sustainable thing to do is to wear your clothing more, but we\u2019ve created a large consumer appetite for wearing different items. Your Friend\u2019s Closet is an affordable rental clothing store for everyday wear. By renting, consumers can have access to a larger closet at a lower price point while reducing textile waste. This service aims to make clothing sustainable by increasing the number of times a clothing item is used and to make clothing affordable by lowering the cost per wear of items. Your Friend\u2019s Closet seeks to become proof that we don\u2019t have to feed into overconsumption to create profit.",

So what does it mean when you can easily recreate faces and change backgrounds simply by clicking a button?

The interactive installation 'Remnant' explores this intriguing concept, focusing on the philosophical aspects of memory remnants and their links to daily experiences. It creatively represents these ideas through an intricate arrangement of up-down moving fragments triggered by the detection of human movement. The fragments represent the memory debris inside our dreams. Thus, 'Remnant' aims to provide audiences with an abstract resonance of their memory debris, encouraging them to contemplate the connections with their real-life experiences.",

For those who have experienced a loss, I hope the work will bring a sense of belonging, and for those who do not have that experience, I hope it delivers an emotional impact that can help explain the process of navigating grief.

In this research, where users engage with virtual assistants for tasks such as setting reminders or perform a simple request, an in-depth survey will be given out to gather feedback and opinion on difference responses being proposed. Recognizing that VUIs can be challenging and exclusive experience for some users; the research aims to establish guidelines for creating intuitive, responsive, and accessible VUIs.",

    "description": "*Through My Eyes Only* is a doomed horror story that follows Rowan, an aspiring photographer who is quickly losing her vision, and\u00a0within months,\u00a0is expected to go blind. Leading up to her impending blindness, she continues to take photographs in a last ditch effort to hold onto her identity as an artist. In a Faustian Bargain for eyesight, Rowan wrestles with her own humanity and morality, who she is as an artist, and how much she values control over her body and mind.\n\nI dreamed up this grotesque story from a real, somewhat illogical fear of my own: going blind and being forced away from my artistic practice. Being a multimedia artist, creation is a part of my everyday life and identity as a person. Throughout the story, I try to emphasize the feelings of lostness, confusion, fear, and helplessness that would come with an integral part of one\u2019s own identity being threatened. Because the film is of the horror genre, I want to focus on isolation and surveillance through visual and non-verbal cues. For example, Rowan does not speak to any other humans throughout the duration of the film. She is alone in every environment: enveloped by the city, her apartment, the red-lit dark room, and the faceless crowds.\n\nInspired by the stylized works of artists like Albert Mielgo and Miguel Ortega and films like SpiderMan: Into the Spiderverse, I want to use the medium of 3D to create a horror film that feels like it\u2019s own little world: a little world designed to unsettle you. \n\nTo start this project, I developed a stylized script from a short story, including photos and short fiction prose. From there, I sketched the two primary characters that I would be modeling later, wanting to emphasize the asymmetrical and abnormal art style of Rowan and the demon character, making the latter an uncanny version of our protagonist.\u00a0From there, I worked in Autodesk Maya and ZBrush for the first time to create some 3D assets while sketching the storyboards to reflect the action of the script.\u00a0Finally, I designed 3 film posters: a main, teaser, and character poster to advertise the film. Presented at the showcase is a pre-production process book, the final draft of the script, character and environment sketches, storyboards of the film, and 3 themed film posters.",

    "description": "Inspired by my grandmother's consistent chiding to learn Spanish, I set out to understand if emerging generative AI technology could make learning a language easier and more efficient. The output is research on what AI technologies exist today for language acquisition, how these technologies fare against other methods of language acquisition, and an experimental game prototype based on what was learned from the research.",

    "description": "This is a series of short films about my everyday life I recorded throughout my semester. Thinking about how monotonous everyday life can be for each of us, I wanted to find the beauty in these seemingly mundane moments. I wanted to create these short films to capture and share these moments. Each short film reflects my own lived reality. Ultimately, my goal is not to provide answers or explanations, but rather to evoke emotions and spark contemplation. Through my short films, I aim to capture the essence of what it means to be alive\u2014to celebrate the beauty of the everyday and find solace in the shared moments that unite us all.",

    "description": "This work is an exploration of the intersection between sound and emotion, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in an auditory journey of introspection and discovery. Drawing from my personal experiences and observations of the world around me, I seek to evoke a range of feelings and sensations through carefully crafted sonic landscapes. Viewers will encounter a rich tapestry of sounds, textures, and rhythms, inviting them to reflect on the complexities of human experience and the power of sound to evoke memories and emotions. In the larger context of contemporary art, my work contributes to the ongoing dialogue surrounding the immersive potential of sound as an artistic medium, offering a unique perspective on the intersection of art, technology, and human perception.",
